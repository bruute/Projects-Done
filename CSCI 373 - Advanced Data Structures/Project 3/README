You have 11 entries for the entire house. This includes all the rooms given
to us in the project details plus the entire floor area. I drew out a map of the house
and gave each room a specific size. In order to manipulate linked lists. I had the list 
go down starting from the hallway in the middle then moving left into dining area, then 
going down and an back up on the right side of the house like a U shape. Then I had all 
the entries set up in a hashtable where I would later use the hashtables again to pull
the correct info in order to show the user the size of each entry.
