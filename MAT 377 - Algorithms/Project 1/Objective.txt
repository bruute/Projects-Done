Project 1:

Implement two sorting algorithm (insertion and merge sort) learned in the class with several inputs from different size.Compare the running time from implementations and write a report of your findings.Start with small size input like 10 integer array and increase your input size until your computer can handle or meaningful results occurs.Use exact algorithm from text book for sorting programming and you can use system clock to measure running time.
