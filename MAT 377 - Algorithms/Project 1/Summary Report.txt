Summary
	I ran both insertion methods in my compiler starting with an array size of 10, then increasing by 10 times as much. The lowest array size was 10 and the highest was one million. Using the merge sort method, an array size of 10 was 0.000098 seconds and array size of one million took 1.684092 seconds. Using the insertion method, an array size of 10 was 0.00082 seconds and an array size of 100,000 was 13.858070 seconds. I wasn’t able to record an array size of one million because I didn’t know when the compiler would finish running the program. In conclusion, the merge sort method was able to handle a large array size but the insertion method was faster with a smaller array size.
